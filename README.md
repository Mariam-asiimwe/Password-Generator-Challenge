# Password-Generator-Challenge

The challenge was designed to allow me to build an application that can be used to generate a random password based on the criteria the user selected using Javascript. The appplication should run in the browser with a responsive interface.

Building the application allowed me to demonstrate my skills as a new developer using but this was not without challenges. They include:
    1. Remembering to use the console to debug the code
    2. Making sure the code runs without any errors
    3. completing the challenge so that the application is anle to generate the random password.
